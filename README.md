# flakBot
A custom bot for Discord with discord.js
____

## Overview

This aim of this project is to explore the design and architecture of a bot user on Discord with the end goal of creating a prototype for my personal server.

______

## User Experience

Much in line with the current standards with existing bot applications, flakBot will have a simple system for users to interact with it featuring a straight-forward key-character interaction system, most likely triggered by a symbol(e.g. !commandName). Features will be added on one by one and documented and commented throughly, with the end goal of having the process laid out in tutorial format to hand off to another junior developer and for my own personal use.
